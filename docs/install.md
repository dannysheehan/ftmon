# Installing FTMON

FTMON is a local, per-user monitor. It must not be installed or run as root:
its database, definitions, actions, web UI, and desktop notifications belong
to the logged-in user (SE-01).

## Install with uv

Python 3.11 or newer and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) are required.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dsheehan/ftmon.git
cd ftmon
uv tool install .
ftmon init
ftmon check
```

For development, use `uv sync` followed by `uv run ftmon ...`. `ftmon init`
creates private directories and installs eight editable built-in definitions.
Running it again preserves existing files; `--force` replaces built-ins only.

## Run the daemon with systemd

The wheel contains `ftmon/systemd/ftmon.service`. With the repository checkout:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp src/ftmon/systemd/ftmon.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now ftmon.service
systemctl --user status ftmon.service
```

The packaged unit expects uv's default `~/.local/bin/ftmon` installation. If
you installed elsewhere, copy the unit and change only `ExecStart`. FTMON is a
user service because running as root would give monitor definitions and actions
authority they neither need nor should have.

## Web dashboard

```sh
ftmon web
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8420/>. The service binds only to loopback and uses no
remote assets. Keep the hostname consistent (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`) so
the write-operation Origin check can protect against DNS rebinding and CSRF.

## MCP registration

Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add ftmon -- ftmon mcp
```

Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ftmon": {
      "command": "/home/YOU/.local/bin/ftmon",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOU` with the account name and restart Claude Desktop. MCP uses stdio;
it does not open another network listener.

## Actions

Actions are an explicit local trust boundary. FTMON never creates, edits, or
changes permissions on files in `~/.config/ftmon/actions/` (AC-03). Create a
script yourself, review it, and make it executable before enabling a monitor
that references its bare filename:

```sh
install -m 0700 my-cleanup ~/.config/ftmon/actions/my-cleanup
ftmon check
```

Actions run only when an incident first opens, at most once per action every
ten minutes. They receive the documented `FTMON_*` environment, no arguments or
shell, and time out after 30 seconds. Output and exit status appear in incident
history.

## Database backups

```sh
ftmon doctor
ftmon doctor --deep
ftmon doctor --backup ~/ftmon-backup.db
```

Do not copy a live `ftmon.db` file. Committed rows may still be in SQLite's WAL;
`doctor --backup` uses SQLite's consistent backup API and verifies the result
(VC-03).
